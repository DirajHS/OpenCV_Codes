## Background foreground Image segmentation
<p align="justify">

Background subtraction is a major preprocessing steps in many vision based applications. For example, consider the cases like visitor counter where a static camera takes the number of visitors entering or leaving the room, or a traffic camera extracting information about the vehicles etc. In all these cases, first we need to extract the person or vehicles alone. Technically, we need to extract the moving foreground from static background.

This project demonstrates the separation of static background from moving foreground of live camera feed.
